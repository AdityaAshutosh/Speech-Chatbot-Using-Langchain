# AI-based Language Processing Project

This project is a comprehensive solution for various language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, and information retrieval. It utilizes the LangChain framework, along with its community and third-party integrations, to demonstrate the capabilities of AI applications.

## Project Overview

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Loading and Processing**: The project uses the `TextLoader` from the `langchain_community` library to load text data from a file. The loaded text is then chunked using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to create smaller, manageable documents.

2. **Embedding and Vector DB Storage**: The project employs the `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` from the `langchain_google_genai` library to generate embeddings for the processed documents. These embeddings are then stored in a vector database using the `FAISS` library from the `langchain_community`.

3. **Querying and Information Retrieval**: The project allows users to query the vector database using a natural language interface. The `ChatPromptTemplate` from the `langchain_core` library is used to design a chat prompt that encourages the AI model to think in-depth before providing an answer. The `create_retrieval_chain` function from the `langchain` library is used to create a retrieval chain that combines the chat prompt with the vector database.

4. **LLM for RAG Pipeline**: The project uses the `OllamaLLM` from the `langchain_ollama` library as the language model for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. This model is used to generate responses to user queries based on the context provided by the vector database.
